            <ul class="text-muted">
              <li><h4>Yacouba Sawadogo is a farmer from <strong><em>Burkina Faso</em></strong> who has been successfully using a traditional farming technique
                called <strong>Zaï</strong> to restore soils damaged by <strong>desertification</strong> and <strong>drought</strong>.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Early life</strong> - He was sent to a religious school where the students often didn't have
                enough to eat. Being the smallest and youngest, he was the one who had to go without.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Background</strong> - The northern portions of Burkina Faso fall in the Sahel Belt, a semi-arid region
                between the Sahara Desert to the north and tropical savannahs further south. The region periodically suffers from drought. The most recent major drought in occurred during the 1970s,
                  resulting in a famine which killed a great number of people.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Soil Rehabilitation</strong> - Together with <em>Mathieu Ouédraogo</em>, another local farm innovator,
                Yacouba Sawadogo began experimenting with techniques for rehabilitating damaged soil in about <strong>1980</strong>. </h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Zaï holes</strong> - Zaï holes also catch water, but take a slightly different approach. They are holes dug in the soil.
                 Traditionally they were used in a limited way to restore barren land. Yacouba Sawadogo introduced the innovation of filling them with manure and other
                 biodegradable waste, in order to provide a source of nutrients for plant life. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help break up the soil further.
                 He also increased the size of the holes slightly over the traditional models. Zaï holes have been used to help cultivate trees, sorghum, and millet.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Outreach</strong> - To promote these methods, particularly zaï holes, Yacouba Sawadogo holds bi-yearly <strong>"Market Days"</strong>
                 at his farm in the village of <em>Gourga</em>. Attendees from over a hundred regional villages come to share seed samples, swap tips, and learn from one another.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><strong>Expansion projects threaten the forest</strong> -Today, Sawadogo is facing serious problems from several quarters. A recent expansion project
                 in the area has taken up a considerable portion of the forest he spent years growing. Homes are already being built on his land, with little compensation being offered.
                 However, his message about the future of the environment and conservation remains profound. <strong><em>“If you cut down ten trees a day and fail to plant even one a year, we are
                   headed for destruction,”</em></strong> he says.</h4></li>
              <li><h4>A documentary feature film <strong><u>The Man Who Stopped the Desert</u></strong> first screened in the UK portrays his life.</h4></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-muted text-center"><small>“Tes of thousands of hectares of land that was completely unproductive has been made productive again thanks to the techniques of Yacouba.”</small></h3>
